Once created by the female android Reese, they then learned to enhance themselves - the Replicators. They proliferate by replication out of metallic matters. If they manage to enter a foreign ship, they use its structure for replication or integrate the taken over ship into their own fleets, so that self destruction sometimes is the only possibility to stop them.<br />By these means they nearly managed to wipe out numerous peoples - and now they threaten the rest of the galaxy with ther checkless urge to expand.
